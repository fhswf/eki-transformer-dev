    observer: minmax #minmax: chooses the clipping range based on the min and max value of the tensor. for other observers, view pytorch quantization api
    #scope: either tensor or channel
    #tensor: qparams (scale and zero value) is applied to an entire layer; 
    #channel: qparams are applied for each weight within the layer
